# Rust ML 

*Work in progress.*

API documentation can be found [here](https://seankim658.github.io/rust-ml/doc/rust_ml/index.html).

## Background 

Learning Rust and brushing up on basic machine learning concepts by building a simple machine learning library, (very) loosely based on the [scikit-learn](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn) Python library. This project is still very much so in the **very** early stages and no real features have been fully implemented yet. Still working on setting up the foundation of the project.

## Dependencies

- [rulinalg](https://github.com/AtheMathmo/rulinalg) is used for some basic linear algebra concepts.
- [num](https://github.com/rust-num/num) is used for the `Float` trait.
- [csv](https://github.com/BurntSushi/rust-csv) is used for CSV handling.
- [serde](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde) is used for deserializing Rust data structures.
